My name is Preston Furlong and I have been a professional student at Weber for a good several years. I had been pursuing a Physics degree for a while when I decided it was something I didn't want to do professionally. So, I'm currently set on finishing with a Data Science degree that was just recently added to Weber.

I work at RC Willey in Syracuse where I sell appliances and electronics. I'm currently waiting on a Visa to bring my fiance from Brazil to come here and marry me. We've been dating for nearly a year and I flew out to meet her for the first time back in December. We're very excited to get the approval.
